# multi-thread-DNS-Lookup

Hello! \
This was a project experimenting with multi-threading to resolve domain names for various websites.

An example input would be a list of domain names, separated by a new line: \
google.com \
apple.com \
instagram.com \
... \
\
And the output of the application would be the domain, comma separated with it's ip address: \
google.com, 172.253.122.100 \
apple.com, 17.253.144.10 \
instagram.com, 157.240.229.174 \
\
In my application, multi-threading sped this process up by nearly 5x.
